## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I've been learning the concept of JavaScript for some time. But now I realize that to actually applying it is quite another thing. I didn't learn to build a complicated function, but I learned to think which variables to declare first etc.

### Continued development

I hope to be more comfortable with JS especially, but HTML and CSS as well.

### Useful resources
